In this first project we focus on using Application Programming Interfaces (or API's)
Our group decided to use three different API's: a face recognition API, a thesaurus API, and GIFy API. 

Our concept comes from wanting to make faster the recent trend in our era of communicating in short bursts of conversation in group text messaging threads. We want to allow users to more quickly search related gify images to send to their friends. 

This application allows a user to upload an image URL. The face recognition API decides an emotion to label it as. Then the emotion is given to the Thesaurus API that finds synonyms (and similar words if none apply). These synonyms are then created into buttons which the user can click and the Gify API will find gifys based on that word and post them for the user to view and save and use (for their conversations)
